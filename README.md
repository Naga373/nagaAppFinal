## about page 
http://localhost:4200/about
This page provides a brief introduction about me. When the "About" button is clicked on the home page, it smoothly transitions to this section with an engaging animation as the content loads. To return to the main home page, simply click on the logo or the "Home" option.

## home Page
http://localhost:4200/home
This is the main page, featuring a smooth transition as it opens. All buttons and options respond interactively by changing color and hovering when the mouse moves near them. When the mouse moves away, they return to their original color with a subtle animation. Every page in this project is designed to be highly responsive.

## Skills Page
http://localhost:4200/skills
This page showcases skill sets in a grid layout for clear visibility and distinction between the sections. The content loads with smooth animations, and the table elements are animated as well, creating a seamless flow that enhances visual appeal and naturally directs attention to the tools I use.

## Project Page 
http://localhost:4200/projects
This page highlights my best projects completed during my masterâ€™s program. The projects are displayed side by side, and as you hover over them, they exhibit a subtle motion effect, adding an engaging interactive element.
